### Features
* Searching music albums by musician

* Sharing favorite albums with friends in messengers

### Used technologies
* [OkHttp3](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) - for network use
* [RxJava 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) - for making async actions more easy =)
* [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) - for downloading images and using placeholders
* [Blurry](https://github.com/wasabeef/Blurry) - for reactive UI (updating RecyclerView items after geting full response)
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) - to simplify work with views without "findViewById"
